  <h2>Research</h2>

<p>
  My research interests lie in the fields of statistical physics, nonlinear dynamics, and quantum dynamics.
  To be specific, these include the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Synchronization in many-body interacting systems</li>
  <li>Random walks and stochastic resetting</li>
  <li>Universality of phase transitions and critical phenomena</li>
  <li>Critical dynamics on long-range disordered systems</li>
  <li>Quantum dynamics on disordered media</li>
</ul>


<p>
  Beyond my primary work, I collaborate widely with both theorists and experimentalists, often developing theoretical frameworks
  to understand physical phenomena (<a href="#GRN"">please see here</a> - <a href="#FD">here</a>). This includes providing theoretical 
  support to experimental realization of synchronizations, applying statistical
  physics approach to biophysics, in particular to understand <i>Gene Regulatory Networks</i> and developing a computational framework
  to explain the behavior of the organism <i>Physurum polycephalum</i> in solving complex computational problems.

  <h3>Long-range interactions, disorder and the universality</h3>
  <img src="figures/fig2_gamma_vs_sigma.jpeg" alt="gamma vs sigma plot" class="research-image-right">
  <p>
    Systems with long-range interactions, characterized by power-law decaying couplings with distance, have long
    been a cornerstone in classical and quantum statistical and condensed matter physics. These systems exhibit a 
    variety of rich, nontrivial behavior both in and out of equilibrium otherwise absent in their short-range
    counterparts. One notable example is that sufficiently slowly decaying interactions can alter the universal
    critical properties and induce phase transition via spontaneous symmetry breaking in low-dimensional systems,
    which is otherwise prohibited by the Mermin-Wagner theorem. The recent surge of interest in such systems 
    is driven by their experimental realizations in atomic, molecular, and optical platforms, along with
    their potential applications in quantum computation.
<p>

</p>
   Universality is a fundamental concept in the field of critical phenomena in statistical physics. It describes 
  how diverse physical systems exhibit the same scaling behavior near criticality, regardless of their microscopic details.
  However, when Euclidean lattices with long-range interactions are generalized to long-range interacting graphs, they
  lack translational invariance and the graph introduces intrinsic disorder. The effect of such quenched disorder
  on the criticality is crucial and remains not fully understood.
<p>

  <p>
    In our recent work, we investigated the role of the spectral dimension ($d_s$) in determining universality classes of models such 
    as the XY and Kuramoto models on long-range disordered graphs. We observed strong finite-size fluctuations in systems with
    $2 < d_s \leq 3$. Next, we study how this quenched graph disorder affects the critical exponents, focusing, in particular,
    on a critical system: the Self-avoiding random walk (SAW), which realizes the $n \to 0$ limit of $\mathcal{O}(n)$ ($n$-vector) model.
    We have developed an <i>algorithm to generate a long-range infinite graph</i> and also a <i>modified SAW algorithm</i>
    to extract the exponents reliably. Their behavior across the long-range to short-range boundary is investigated
    in detail and is compared with that of the ‘clean’ self-avoiding Levy flight on a weighted graph.

  <h3>Quantum dynamics: Anderson localization</h3>
  <img src="figures/fig3_LR_graph.jpeg" alt="LR graph" class="research-image">
  <p>
    Over six decades after Anderson's seminal work, Anderson localization remains a cornerstone in understanding disorder-induced quantum phenomena. 
    A striking development in recent years is its correspondence with many-body localization. Another unexpected result is the robust localization 
    of all bulk eigenstates in long-range interacting systems, such as dipolar models, even beyond the limits of conventional theoretical
    methods. A graph-theoretic model serves as a valuable platform for probing the interplay between structure and disorder in quantum transport.

   In particular, we investigate Anderson localization on a long-range disordered graph with tunable disorder via 
   long-range link sparsity, to understand if sparse long-range graphs and fully connected long-range Hamiltonians belong 
   to the same universality class of localization transitions.

  <h3>Synchronization</h3>
  <img src="figures/fig0_final-shuffling.gif" alt="shuffling" class="research-image-right">
  <p>
    The phenomenon of spontaneous collective synchronization in a complex dynamical system comprising many interacting degrees of 
    freedom is one of the most fascinating emergent behaviors observed in nature. It is ubiquitous across a wide range of scales, 
    from atoms to celestial objects. The Kuramoto model serves as a paradigm for studying such phenomena. In general, it belongs 
    to a generic class of nonequilibrium or driven systems that violate the principle of detailed balance, leading to nonzero loops 
    of probability current in configuration space. Unlike equilibrium ones, there is no general framework to study 
    nonequilibrium systems. Understanding the properties of nonequilibrium stationary states, as well as their equilibrium 
    counterparts, was one of the primary goals of my doctoral research. During this time, I extensively investigated the effects of 
    nearest-neighbor interactions (local coupling) and stochasticity on synchronization in the Kuramoto model and its relaxation 
    dynamics, employing various analytical and computational techniques from statistical physics. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Our recent focus has been on controlling and manipulating such systems. Synchronization is crucial for proper functionality, 
    survival, and adaptation across various length and time scales in natural and engineered systems. Attaining synchronization 
    often comes with unavoidable energy costs under limited resources. For example, in the Kai system underlying the cyanobacterial
    circadian clock, energy dissipation drives coupling between oscillators, with synchronization emerging beyond a critical 
    dissipation threshold. Motivated by such examples, we recently introduced a novel protocol of shuffling of oscillator frequencies,
    which we show to be inducing synchrony even in static networks under otherwise unfavorable conditions. This mechanism has 
    also been experimentally realized.

  <h3>Random walks and stochastic resetting</h3>
  <img src="figures/fig1_comb_reset.jpeg" alt="random comb" class="research-image">
  <p> Sometimes, it's best to simply give up and start afresh! Repeated interruption and resetting of a dynamics to a particular
    condition can alter significantly the resulting properties, both static and dynamic, yielding non-trivial nonequilibrium
    stationary states and enhancing efficiencies in search processes. Over the past decade, stochastic resetting has emerged as
    a powerful mechanism to control and optimize dynamical processes in nonequilibrium set-ups. While most studies focus on non-interacting 
    stochastic systems, our work is among the first to apply resetting to many-body interacting and deterministic dynamical systems. 

    Specifically, within the ambit of the Kuramoto model, we demonstrate that an introduction of resetting leads to
     the emergence of a synchronized phase, even in parameter regimes where the bare model does not support synchronization. 
     Recently, we have extended this approach to include Gaussian white noise and developed an approximate framework
    for nonequilibrium steady states.
    <p>

    </p> Random walks on disordered graphs serve as useful models for transport in physical systems. One such graph realizes a random comb, 
    which consists of a one-dimensional backbone lattice, from each site of which emanates a branch of random length. The randomness in branch
    lengths introduces quenched disorder into the dynamics. The random comb provides a simple yet nontrivial playground that captures essential
    features of many spatially disordered systems, including finitely ramified fractals and percolation clusters.

    We study the effect of quenched disorder on transport properties and provide exact results for non-interacting biased random walkers in
    the presence of stochastic resetting. The interplay between quenched disorder and the external field in the dynamics leads to various
    nontrivial phenomena, such as a drift velocity that varies non-monotonically with the applied field due to the trapping of particles
    in the branches. We show how resetting helps mitigate branch trapping. We further extend the study by incorporating particle interactions
    and obtain exact results for transport properties in the case of the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP).

  <h3>Stochasticity in Gene Regulatory Networks</h3>
  <img src="figures/fig4_GRN.jpeg" alt="GRN" class="research-image-right">
  <p>
    Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs), laying out the blueprint for gene expression, govern the identity, functions,
      and behavior of a biological cell. These networks consist of interconnected genes and their products, including 
      transcription factors (TFs), RNA molecules, and proteins, which regulate each other 
      through molecular interactions. GRNs are responsible for key biological processes like
      cell differentiation, development, and tissue homeostasis to stress responses, metabolic regulation, and disease progression.
<p>

</p>
   Nonlinearities and inherent stochasticities plays a crucial role in shaping gene expression dynamics. These factors lead to variability 
   in gene activity, resulting in diverse cellular phenotypes. Our research explores the role of stochastic fluctuations in GRNs,
   focusing on how they contribute to phenotypic diversity, guide cell fate decisions, and enable populations to adapt 
   to environmental stresses or changes, and help synthetic biology applications. Additionally, we explore how these insights
  can aid in synthetic biology applications.

  <h3>Solving combinatorial optimization problem by unicellular amoeboid organism</h3>

    Rapidly and accurately selecting optimal moves is a vital skill for organisms,

    traveling salesman problem (TSP) by reshaping to avoid light stimuli, with solution time scaling 
    linearly with problem size. We focus on developing a computational framework borrowing concepts from 
    nonlinear dynamics and statistical physics to replicate and explain this behavior.

  <h3>Fluctuation-dissipation relation in coupled oscillator systems</h3>
  <p> 

    The fluctuation-dissipation relation, a fundamental concept in equilibrium statistical physics,
    relates intrinsic fluctuations in a system at equilibrium with its linear response to external perturbations.
    In our study, we explore this relation in a non-equilibrium setting, specifically within a system of coupled phase oscillators.

    We introduce both microscopic and macroscopic correlation functions to characterize the fluctuations in this
    noisy coupled oscillator system. We recently derive the relations between these correlation functions and the system's 
    response to an external force and gain insights into the dynamical behavior of the system.
